### Software
#### Puckboard
Led the first operational deployment of the new flight scheduling system Puckboard. Lead continuous development efforts with Tron and are working to transition to a program of record. Learn more about Puckboard [here](https://trongov.us/portfolio/puckboard/).

#### Mobile Training Logging
Designing and deploying the first ever EFB app that allows aircrew to fill out their post mission paperwork from anywhere in the world. This project saves 12 Airmen from manually calculating hours between two times, doing basic math, and most importantly from transcribing handwritten data into the system of record.

#### Airmen Coders
Founded the Airmen Coders program to empower any Airmen to code for mission success. Learn more and join the community at [AirmenCoders.us](https://airmencoders.us). 

#### Tron Partnership
Partnered to transform Airmen Coders & Tron from Air Force specific to DoD wide. Created Military Coders, secured significant funding for service member software development enablement. Including formal software courses. 90 service members enrolled to date in 3 month full time courses. Providing an end to end OT&E pipeline for service members who code. Currently transitioning this effort to its long term home.

#### Mattermost
Palmetto Spark worked with Platform One to roll out the chat system Mattermost and manned the initial support help desk. Now in use by 50 wings/equivalents around the DoD. Aircrew around the world are now using it to securely pass mission critical information. A trial has begun with TACC. Many AOCs/Career fields have used it to enhance teleworking capabilities. This effort has taken on a life of its own and will be presented as a finalist for the AMC Phoenix Spark Tank competition by HQ AMC/A6 and the Digital Aircrew Initiative. 

#### MQF Study App
MQF Study EFB App: Built an iPad app for our EFBs that allows Aircrew members to study for their master question file tests. Since expanded from C-17s to KC-135, C-130H, C-21, KC-10, KC-46, AE, C-5M, and the C-130J.



### COVID Response
#### Hand Sanitizer

   Supplied hand sanitizer to an Aeromedical Evacuation unit and they were able to deploy it around the world rapidly.   
   
#### 3D Printed Face Masks

   In development to provide to CE Structures for both COVID-19 and occupational safety advantages. 
   
#### 3D Printed Face Shields

   Completed. Provided the dental clinic with extra face shields during the initial COVID-19 surge.  
   
#### CSAF/CMSAF Visit

   Shared ideas and progress with senior AF leadership in an effort to bolster support of innovation across the Air Force.  
   
#### 3D Printed Door Openers

  Developed for use in opening doors without touching the handles to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  
  

#### 3D Printed Plexi Holders for CES

   Developed 3D printable mounts for holding plexiglass to ensure simultaneous safety and face to face interaction for the CES offices.
