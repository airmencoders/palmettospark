## Squadron Innovation Funds (SIF)
In an era of great power competition, our squadrons, more than ever, are the heartbeat of the Air Force. To foster innovation at the level of command that makes the greatest impact, Secretary Heather Wilson and General David L. Goldfein initiated a second year of Squadron Innovation Funds (SIF) for fiscal year 2019 so commanders can tackle their most pressing readiness and national-security challenges. In keeping with previous guidance, we must continue to THINK BIG, start small, and Scale Fast. To learn more about SIF swing by the innovation lab.

## AFWERX
AFWERX is a network of people who want to help create a better Air Force for all Airmen. There are innovators who work for AFWERX full-time, others who take on passion projects outside of their traditional jobs and tap into the AFWERX ecosystem for support, and plenty more who collaborate with us as part of their position at Air Force bases around the world.
Because AFWERX is fueled by people with a diverse set of skills, passions and roles in the Air Force, the list of initiatives and resources we have access to is always growing. The following outline of resources for Airmen is not all-inclusive, but it is a starting point for understanding the AFWERX ecosystem and how to make use of it at your units, wings, major commands, and within the Air Force as a whole.

## Spark Tank
Spark Tank is an annual event where Airmen pitch innovative ideas to top Air Force leadership and a panel of industry experts. Hosted each year at the Air Force Associationâ€™s Warfare Symposium, thousands of attendees watch as Air Force leaders encourage Airmen to disrupt the status quo.

Finalists are selected based on specific capabilities as well as concerns of safety, policy, Air Force-wide implementation, technical feasibility and scalability. Following the event, they receive project management support and other resources to implement their ideas. Contact us to learn how to submit ideas.

## SBIR
AFWERX, in partnership with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), and the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), developed the SBIR Open Topics to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and transition rate of the SBIR program.
Through a competitive awards-based program, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. Learn more about SBIRs [here](https://www.afwerx.af.mil/sbir.html) or swing by the lab to discuss. Palmetto Spark has several active SBIRs.
