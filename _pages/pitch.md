Applicants should be highly motivated to both improve processes and innovate. They should have a passion for helping our fellow Airmen while making the Air Force a more lethal force and a better place to work. While organizational skills, leadership ability, and technical skills are a bonus the Airmen we hire will have one trait in common: they care. We believe an Airmen that cares will take the time to learn needed skills and will be humble enough to admit to and learn from their mistakes. Our team will have diversity of thought and experience. 

Airmen do NOT need commander or supervisor approval to apply but if selected Palmetto Spark will work with Commanders for release if their mission needs can support the Airmen being on loan.
